The SOFA/ambiX binaural rendering (SABRE) toolkit described here is an open-source collection of MATLAB functions for generating custom binaural decoders.
The toolkit allows a user to construct, using any SOFA-formatted HRTFs, a custom binaural rendering configuration for the ambiX binaural plug-in.
Also implemented in the toolkit are several methods of HRTF interpolation, as well as common HRTF equalization options.
The toolkit is freely available online.\citefooturl{SABREToolkitURL}
