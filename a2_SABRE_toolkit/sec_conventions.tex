In accordance with the ambiX specification~\citep{Nachbar2011},
we use real-valued spherical harmonics as given by~\eqnref{eq:02_Acoustical_Theory:Spherical_Harmonic}.
We also adopt the Schmidt seminormalized (SN3D) spherical harmonic normalization convention with Condon-Shortley phase,
as given by~\eqnref{eq:02_Acoustical_Theory:Spherical_Harmonic_SN3D_Normalization},
as well as the ambisonics channel numbering (ACN) convention, as described in~\secref{sec:02_Acoustical_Theory:Definitions}.
