\chapter{Experimental validation of numerical simulations}\label{chap:10_Experimental_Validation}
In this chapter, we present an experimental validation of the numerical simulation framework described in \chapref{chap:06_Simulation_Framework}.
To that end, we conduct acoustical measurements corresponding to a subset of the simulations presented in \chapref{chap:08_Proposed_Method} and compare the resulting metric values between measurement and simulation.
Through these analyses, we seek to establish the domains over which our numerical simulations accurately represent reality and additionally identify any major sources of discrepancy between simulations and measurements.
