\chapter{Simulation framework for performance characterization}\label{chap:06_Simulation_Framework}
In this chapter, we lay out a simulation framework for characterizing the performance of different navigational techniques.
In the following sections, we describe the geometry of the simulated sound field, define the parameters of the simulations, and enumerate the metrics which will be computed.
In each of the following chapters, we present results characterizing and comparing different navigational methods obtained by conducting the simulations described here.
Additionally, in \chapref{chap:10_Experimental_Validation}, an experimental validation of the simulations is presented.
