Generally, we seek the ambisonics signals, $a_n$, up to order $L_\text{out}$, that describe the sound field in the vicinity of the listener, located at $\vec{r}_0$.
Using \eqnref{eq:02_Acoustical_Theory:Finite_Order_Expansion}, this potential field is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:03_Navigation_Techniques:Output_Potential_Field}
\psi(k,\vec{r} + \vec{r}_0) = \sum_{n=0}^{N_\text{out} - 1} 4\pi (-i)^l A_n(k) j_l(kr) \frac{Y_n(\hat{r})}{\|Y_n\|^2} ,
\end{equation}
where $N_\text{out} = (L_\text{out} + 1)^2$ and $A_n = \mathcal{F} \left[ a_n \right]$.

We take as inputs to each navigational method a set of measured (or synthesized) ambisonics signals, $b_n$, up to order $L_\text{in}$, that describe the sound field in the vicinity of the microphone (either real or virtual), which is located at $\vec{u}$.
Again using \eqnref{eq:02_Acoustical_Theory:Finite_Order_Expansion}, this potential field is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:03_Navigation_Techniques:Input_Potential_Field}
\psi(k,\vec{r} + \vec{u}) = \sum_{n=0}^{N_\text{in} - 1} 4\pi (-i)^l B_n(k) j_l(kr) \frac{Y_n(\hat{r})}{\|Y_n\|^2} ,
\end{equation}
where $N_\text{in} = (L_\text{in} + 1)^2$ and $B_n = \mathcal{F} \left[ b_n \right]$.
Thus, estimation of $a_n$ from $b_n$ amounts to a translation from the position of the microphone, $\vec{u}$, along the vector $\vec{r}_0 - \vec{u}$, as illustrated in \figref{fig:03_Navigation_Techniques:Problem_Formulation}.

In general, we will consider arrays of $P$ ambisonics microphones, where the $p^\text{th}$ microphone is located at $\vec{u}_p$ for $p \in [1,P]$.
For microphones of order $L_\text{in}$,\footnote{The order of the ambisonics microphone is generally determined by the number of capsules in the assembly.} each microphone captures $N_\text{in} = (L_\text{in} + 1)^2$ ambisonics signals, which we represent with a vector, $\mathbf{b}_p$.
(See \chapref{chap:02_Acoustical_Theory} for a review of ambisonics conventions and theory.)
%In general, ambisonics navigation techniques aim to approximate, up to order $L_\text{out}$ and with $N_\text{out} = (L_\text{out} + 1)^2$ terms, the exact ambisonics signals, $\mathbf{a}$, of the sound field at a listening position $\vec{r}_0$.
In the case of extrapolation methods, for which $P = 1$, we omit the subscripts for $\vec{u}_1$ and $\mathbf{b}_1$ (and instead simply use $\vec{u}$ and $\mathbf{b}$, respectively).
