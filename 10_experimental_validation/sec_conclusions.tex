In order to validate our numerical simulations, we conducted a set of acoustical measurements, as described in \secref{sec:10_Experimental_Validation:Experiments}, taken over a subset of the simulated conditions presented in \chapref{chap:08_Proposed_Method}.
Results of these measurements are in good agreement with those of the simulations, indicating that our simulations are indeed representative of reality.
In particular, spectral error discrepancies are consistently smaller than $1$~dB and diffuseness discrepancies are consistently smaller than $0.1$ across all frequencies within approximately $300$~Hz to $10$~kHz.%
\footnote{The significant discrepancies observed at high frequencies can be explained by spatial aliasing, an effect which we do not currently account for in our simulations, but could potentially be incorporated in the future with a simple model based on the geometrical arrangement of capsules on the spherical microphone array used in the measurements.}
Additionally, level discrepancies are consistently within $2$~dB and localization direction discrepancies are consistently within $5^\circ$ ($3.5^\circ$ on average) across all microphone spacings.
A more comprehensive validation of our simulation framework could consider alternative navigational methods and span wider ranges of microphone spacings and source positions.
However, as expected, the present results suggest that the observed discrepancies (and therefore the fidelity of the simulations) do not depend significantly on the navigational method, microphone spacing, or source position.
