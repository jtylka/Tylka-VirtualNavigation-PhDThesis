%%%% COMPARISON TO THIERGART'S METHOD %%%%
\chapter{Comparison to time-frequency analysis and sound field modeling}\label{chap:09_Thiergart_Comparison}
In this chapter, we present a comparison of the time-frequency navigational method of \citet{Thiergart2013}, described here in 
\secref{sec:03_Navigation_Techniques:Thiergart_Method}, and our parametric method proposed in \chapref{chap:08_Proposed_Method}.
To that end, we present a characterization of the time-frequency method via numerical simulations that are nearly identical to those presented in \secref{sec:08_Proposed_Method:Results}.
Through these analyses, we aim to derive practically-relevant principles that will inform decisions regarding which method to use under various conditions or for different applications.

%Results of these simulations show that each method offers advantages in different regimes of parameters (e.g., microphone spacing, source distance, etc.), and consequently the choice of method should be determined based on its intended application.
%For example, the time-frequency method may be preferable for large-area recordings and when spatial localization accuracy is critical, as this method yields superior localization performance (compared to the proposed method) at large microphone spacings ($>1$~m).
%However, the proposed method may be more suitable for many consumer applications in which sound quality attributes such as coloration and diffuseness are more important, since this method achieves smaller spectral errors at large microphone spacings and smaller diffuseness errors under all conditions.
