\chapter{MATLAB toolkit for ambisonics-to-binaural rendering}\label{chap:A2_SABRE_Toolkit}
In this appendix, we reproduce a prior publication \citep{TylkaChoueiri2017b} in which we presented an open-source collection of MATLAB functions, referred to as the SOFA/ambiX binaural rendering (SABRE) toolkit, which can be used to generate custom ambisonics-to-binaural decoders for the ambiX binaural plug-in.
Although databases of head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) are becoming widely available in the recently-standardized  ``SOFA format'' (spatially-oriented format for acoustics), there was previously no (easy) way to use custom HRTFs with the ambiX binaural plug-in.
The SABRE toolkit enables the user to generate custom binaural rendering configurations for the plug-in from any SOFA-formatted HRTFs or to add HRTFs to an existing ambisonics decoder.
As described below, implemented in the toolkit are various approaches for ambisonics decoding as well as several methods of HRTF interpolation and equalization.

\section*{Acknowledgements}
The SABRE toolkit relies on the ambiX ambisonic plug-in suite by \citet{Kronlachner2013,ambiXPlugInURL} and requires head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) stored in the SOFA format \citep{AES69-2015,SOFAMainPageURL}.
Accordingly, the SOFA API for MATLAB is needed to import the HRTF files (available online).\citefooturl{SOFAAPIURL}
The toolkit was originally presented by \citet{TylkaChoueiri2017b} at the 143\textsuperscript{rd} Convention of the Audio Engineering Society.
