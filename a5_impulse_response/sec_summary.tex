The exponential sine sweep (ESS) enables a high-SNR measurement of the impulse response of an acoustical system.
Additionally, it tends to isolate and remove a significant portion of non-linear distortion terms.
Different implementations of the ESS have been developed, and different approaches exist to extract the system's IR from the measured response (see \secref{sec:A5_Impulse_Response:ESS}).
In this appendix, we discussed issues surrounding these different approaches and, based on that discussion, we concluded that a phase-controlled ESS (see \secref{sec:A5_Impulse_Response:PC-ESS}) up to the Nyquist frequency is generally sufficient to obtain a reasonably high-SNR measurement.
