Recently, we have begun an on-going project to measure HRTFs and 3D scans of the head and upper torso of human subjects and mannequins, and compile the data into a freely available database.
The project primarily aims to address the lack of such data.
Here, we describe details of the measurement procedures used to acquire the data and the subsequent signal processing performed.
For each subject, 648 HRTFs are measured at a distance of 0.76~m in an anechoic chamber.
We also visualize a sample of the data to illustrate that the HRTFs included in our database are free of significant artifacts and noise.
The HRTF data are stored in the standardized ``SOFA format'' (spatially-oriented format for acoustics), with separate files for BIRs, RIRs, and HRIRs (see \secref{sec:A4_HRTF_Measurements:Data_Processing}), and the database is freely available online from the 3D Audio and Applied Acoustics Laboratory at Princeton University.\citefooturl{3D3ALabHRTFDatabaseURL}
