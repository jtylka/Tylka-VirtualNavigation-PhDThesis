To verify that the our measured HRTFs are free of artifacts (e.g., pre-responses prior to the main impulses), we generate a surface plot of ITD estimated from measured HRTFs using a thresholding approach (see, for example, \citet{KatzNoisternig2014}) with a 20\% threshold.
\Figref{fig:Sample_ITD_surface} shows this surface plot for one of the subjects in our database.
This plot shows a plausible ITD surface, as it is generally smooth and free of discontinuities, suggesting that the data are free of significant artifacts, noise, or any other errors.
