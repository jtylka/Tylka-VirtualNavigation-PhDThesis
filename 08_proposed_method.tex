\chapter{Parametric exclusion of invalid microphones and comparison to weighted-average interpolation}\label{chap:08_Proposed_Method}
In this chapter, we propose an interpolation-based method for virtual navigation, wherein the subset of microphones to be used is parametrically determined to ensure that the region of validity restriction is not violated.
We take an existing, weighted-average-based navigational method as a benchmark due to its simplicity and its applicability to arbitrary sound fields, and present a comprehensive characterization and comparison of the performance of both methods following the numerical simulation framework laid out in \chapref{chap:06_Simulation_Framework}.
Through these analyses, we aim to demonstrate the improvement in performance achieved by the proposed method (compared to the benchmark) and, in particular, explore the penalties incurred by the benchmark method when the region of validity restriction is violated.
