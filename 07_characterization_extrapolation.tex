\chapter{Performance errors incurred by linear extrapolation methods}\label{chap:07_Characterization_Extrapolation}
In this chapter, we evaluate, through a comprehensive set of the numerical simulations described in \chapref{chap:06_Simulation_Framework}, the performance of two extrapolation-based navigational methods.
The methods considered here are chosen for their broad applicability to arbitrary sound fields due to the linear nature of the processing involved.
However, these methods are also susceptible to violating the region of validity restriction (see \secref{sec:02_Acoustical_Theory:Helmholtz_Equation}) if the listener attempts to navigate beyond the distance of the nearest source to the microphone.
Through the analyses presented here, we aim to determine, in terms of the metrics enumerated in \secref{sec:06_Simulation_Framework:Metrics}, the nature and degree of any penalties incurred by violating this region of validity restriction.

%In the first method, a plane-wave decomposition is employed to simplify the translation operation, however different methods and grid distributions for the plane-wave decomposition can introduce varying errors.
%Consequently, these parameters are first explored in isolation via numerical simulations of a single-microphone array, as described in \chapref{chap:06_Simulation_Framework}.
%Results show that matching the number of plane-waves to the number of ambisonics signals and employing the ``beamforming'' plane-wave decomposition method yields the most reliable results.
%%NOTE%% for the paper, make sure we establish right away the universality of this paper in that it should apply to all linear methods

%The second navigational method employs spherical harmonic translation coefficients to directly extrapolate the ambisonics signals.
%Performance errors are characterized for both methods via numerical simulations in terms of the metrics identified in \secref{sec:06_Simulation_Framework:Metrics}.
%Results show that both methods tend to exhibit two distinct regimes of behavior for far- and near-field sources, and that the performance for near-field sources is often degraded (compared to that for far-field sources) due to the violation of the region of validity restriction.
%In particular, both methods were found to incur significant errors in both overall level and localization when the region of validity restriction is violated.
%Additionally, the plane-wave translation method is shown to perform well for far-field sources, whereas the ambisonics translation method yields significant errors which tend to increase steadily with navigation distance.
