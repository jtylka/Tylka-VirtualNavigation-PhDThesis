\chapter{Review of acoustical and ambisonic theory}\label{chap:02_Acoustical_Theory}
In this chapter, we review relevant acoustical and ambisonic theory which will be employed throughout this thesis.
First, in \secrefthru{sec:02_Acoustical_Theory:Coordinate_System}{sec:02_Acoustical_Theory:Helmholtz_Equation}, we review the spherical Fourier-Bessel series solution to the free-field Helmholtz equation in three dimensions, which provides a frequency-domain representation of any sound pressure field in spherical coordinates.
These solutions lay the mathematical foundation for ambisonics, which we adopt to formulate the problem of virtual navigation in general, as described in \secref{sec:03_Navigation_Techniques:Problem_Formulation}, as well as to describe the implementation of each existing navigational method reviewed in \secreftwo{sec:03_Navigation_Techniques:Extrapolation_Methods}{sec:03_Navigation_Techniques:Interpolation_Methods}.

Next, in \secref{sec:02_Acoustical_Theory:Ambisonics_Encoding}, we review the so-called \textit{ambisonic encoding} equations for synthesizing ambisonics signals for point-sources and plane-waves.
These encoding equations are employed in order to simulate simple incident sound fields, as described in \chapref{chap:06_Simulation_Framework}.
These simulations are later used to comprehensively characterize the performance of various navigational methods, as described in \chaprefthru{chap:07_Characterization_Extrapolation}{chap:09_Thiergart_Comparison}.

In \secref{sec:02_Acoustical_Theory:Plane-Wave_Expansion}, we provide equations for converting between spherical-harmonic (i.e., ambisonic) and plane-wave representations of a sound field, a process which is used in the plane-wave translation method reviewed in \secref{sec:03_Navigation_Techniques:PW_Technique}.
The conversion from ambisonics to plane-wave signals is also used in the plane-wave-based ambisonics-to-binaural rendering approach described in \secref{sec:02_Acoustical_Theory:PW_Quadrature_Binaural}, as well as in the localization model proposed in \secref{sec:05_Proposed_Models:Localization_Model}.
Next, in \secref{sec:02_Acoustical_Theory:Ambisonics_Translation}, we review the spherical Fourier-Bessel translation coefficients, which are needed for the ambisonics translation method reviewed in \secref{sec:03_Navigation_Techniques:SR_Technique}.

Finally, in \secref{sec:02_Acoustical_Theory:Binaural_Rendering}, we review three linear ambisonics-to-binaural rendering approaches, one of which is employed in the listening experiments presented in \chapref{chap:05_Proposed_Models}, and all three of which have been implemented in the MATLAB toolkit described in \apxref{chap:A2_SABRE_Toolkit}.
