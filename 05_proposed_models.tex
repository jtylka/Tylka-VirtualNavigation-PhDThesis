\chapter{Auditory models for evaluating navigational methods}\label{chap:05_Proposed_Models}
In this chapter, we propose and validate models that predict perceived source localization (i.e., the direction of a source relative to the listener) and spectral coloration (changes in the spectral content of a sound) for the specific purpose of evaluating navigational methods for ambisonics-encoded sound fields.
Previous evaluations of navigational methods have typically relied on binaural localization models, which conflate the effects of the navigational method with those of the adopted ambisonics-to-binaural rendering approach, and previous studies on navigation-induced coloration have been largely qualitative.
Consequently, in this chapter, we seek to develop perceptually-relevant auditory models that can be applied directly to translated ambisonics impulse responses (i.e., before rendering to binaural) and give numerical predictions for localization direction and coloration.
