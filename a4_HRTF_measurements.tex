\chapter{Head-related transfer function measurements}\label{chap:A4_HRTF_Measurements}
In this appendix, we describe the measurement and data processing procedures employed in the present thesis (see \chapref{chap:05_Proposed_Models}) to capture the head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) of human subjects.
These procedures were developed and published as part of an on-going project to generate a database of HRTF and morphological measurements of humans and mannequins \citep{Sridhar2017}.
Since only a few such databases are freely available, this database was created to facilitate the development of data-driven HRTF estimation techniques, which require large datasets of measured HRTFs and morphological data.
In the original paper, the head scanning and corresponding processing procedures are also described, but we omit these details here.

The on-going project to generate a database of HRTF and morphological measurements has been approved by the Institutional Review Board for human subjects research at Princeton University.
The database was originally presented by \citet{Sridhar2017} at the 143\textsuperscript{rd} Convention of the Audio Engineering Society.
